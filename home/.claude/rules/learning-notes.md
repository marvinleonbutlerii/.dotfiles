# Learning Notes

## Rule

After completing substantive work, write a concise learning note named `FOR.<yourname>.md`. Place it in `docs/` if that directory exists; otherwise place it in the repository root.

## Required Content

- Architecture overview and how parts connect
- Key technical decisions and tradeoffs
- Tools and technologies used and how they fit together
- Bugs or surprises encountered (or "none") and their resolutions
- Pitfalls to avoid next time and best practices discovered
- 2-5 takeaways that teach good engineering thinking

## Scope

Do not skip this step unless the user explicitly says to. Do not include secrets. Claims labeled as `inferred` are acceptable when marked as such.
