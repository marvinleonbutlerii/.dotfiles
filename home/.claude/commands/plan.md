# /plan - Create a Plan

Create a structured plan for a task or feature.

## Usage

```
/plan [description of task]
```

## Examples

```
/plan Implement user authentication
/plan Refactor the database layer
/plan Add dark mode support
```

## Implementation

When the user runs `/plan`, engage the planning skill and:

1. Clarify the goal and constraints
2. Explore options if multiple approaches exist
3. Break down into atomic tasks
4. Present a sequenced execution plan
5. Wait for user approval before proceeding

Output should follow the planning skill format with clear steps and checkpoints.
